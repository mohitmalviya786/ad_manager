## Key Features Implementation

### 1. Campaign Management
```typescript
// Campaign creation with multi-platform support
interface Campaign {
  id: string
  name: string
  platform: 'google' | 'facebook' | 'instagram' | 'youtube'
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'paused' | 'completed'
  budget: number
  startDate: Date
  endDate: Date
  targeting: TargetingConfig
  creatives: AdCreative[]
}
```

### 2. Analytics Dashboard
```typescript
// Real-time performance metrics
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  impressions: number
  clicks: number
  spend: number
  conversions: number
  ctr: number
  cpc: number
  roas: number
}
```

### 3. Payment Integration
```typescript
// Subscription management
interface Subscription {
  id: string
  plan: 'starter' | 'professional' | 'enterprise'
  status: 'active' | 'canceled' | 'past_due'
  currentPeriodStart: Date
  currentPeriodEnd: Date
  amount: number
}
```

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Business Metrics
