#### 🎨 **Updated Design Theme:**

##### 🌈 **Primary UI Gradient:**

`linear-gradient(135deg, #4776bd, #e84a6c)`

* This vibrant **blue-to-pink gradient** should be the **main visual element** in the app’s UI — used in headers, buttons, highlights, call-to-actions (CTAs), and loading indicators.
* Use **white** and **neutral grays (#f7f7f7, #1a1a1a)** for backgrounds and text to contrast the vibrant gradient.

##### 🌓 **Dark & Light Modes:**

* Light Mode: Gradient on key elements (buttons, topbar); soft white/gray for backgrounds
* Dark Mode: Gradient remains but toned slightly; backgrounds in deep gray/black
* Maintain high contrast for accessibility

##### ✨ **Animations & Interactions:**

* Smooth hover/focus effects on all interactive elements
* Page transitions with soft fades or slides
* Card hover effects (lift, subtle glow)
* Animated progress bars and loaders with the gradient applied

##### 🧑‍🎨 **UI Style:**

* Clean, modern, minimal — **not cluttered**
* Use **card-based layouts** for campaigns, metrics, and reports
* Use **icons + labels**, not icons alone (for clarity)
* Typography: Professional, readable fonts like **Inter**, **Poppins**, or **Roboto**

##### 📱 **Responsive Layout:**

* Mobile-first with smooth transitions
* Sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu on smaller screens
* Touch-friendly UI elements

---

#### 📊 **Performance Goals:**

* <2s page load time
* <200ms API response
* 99.9% uptime SLA

---

#### 💰 **Revenue Model:**

* Tiered subscription model (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
* Stripe for billing
* No hidden fees or markup on ad spend
